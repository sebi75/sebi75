- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Sebastian Semeniuc
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in building all kinds of software using React.js, React-Native, Node.js, Golang, Python
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently making an application like instagram using react-native with typescript, @redux-toolkit and firebase, maybe later build its own api instead of using the firebase's backend as a service.
- ğŸ“« How to reach me - DM me on twitter, instagram, email me or wherever you can send me a message!
